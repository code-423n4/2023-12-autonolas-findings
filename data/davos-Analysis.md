Missing Return Value in getUserPoint Function:


In the provided Solidity contract, the getUserPoint function is designed to return a PointVoting struct. However, the function fails to return a value when the user has no points (i.e., userNumPoints <= 0). This leads to a compilation error because the function is expected to always return a PointVoting struct.

Impact
The absence of a return statement in cases where the user has no points prevents the contract from compiling. This issue could lead to deployment failures and potential loss of funds. Furthermore, it hinders the functionality of the contract, as other parts of the contract or external contracts might rely on this function to retrieve user points.

Proof of Concept
Let's demonstrate the issue with a simplified version of the contract:
``````
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

struct PointVoting {
   int128 bias;
   int128 slope;
   uint64 ts;
   uint64 blockNumber;
   uint128 balance;
}

interface IVEOLAS {
   function getNumUserPoints(address account) external view returns (uint256 userNumPoints);
   function getUserPoint(address account, uint256 idx) external view returns (PointVoting memory uPoint);
}

contract TestContract {
   IVEOLAS ve;

   constructor(IVEOLAS _ve) {
       ve = _ve;
   }

   function getUserPoint(address account, uint256 idx) public view returns (PointVoting memory uPoint) {
       uint256 userNumPoints = ve.getNumUserPoints(account);
       if (userNumPoints > 0) {
           uPoint = ve.getUserPoint(account, idx);
       }
   }
}


//In this simplified contract, the getUserPoint function attempts to retrieve a user point if the user has one or //more points. However, if the user has no points, the function does not return a value, causing a compilation //error.

//To fix this issue, we should modify the function to always return a PointVoting struct. Here's the corrected //function:

function getUserPoint(address account, uint256 idx) public view returns (PointVoting memory uPoint) {
   uint256 userNumPoints = ve.getNumUserPoints(account);
   if (userNumPoints > 0) {
       uPoint = ve.getUserPoint(account, idx);
   } else {
       // Return a default struct if the user has no points
       uPoint = PointVoting({bias: 0, slope: 0, ts: 0, blockNumber: 0, balance: 0});
   }
}
``````

With this modification, the function now always returns a PointVoting struct, resolving the compilation error.
