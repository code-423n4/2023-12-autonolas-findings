## a) The approach I followed when reviewing the code

First, by examining the scope of the code, I determined my code review and analysis strategy.

Accordingly, I analyzed and audited the subject in the following steps;

| Number |Stage |Details|Information|
|:--|:----------------|:------|:------|
|1|Compile and Run Test|[Installation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-autonolas?tab=readme-ov-file#tests)|Test and installation structure is simple, cleanly designed|
|2|Architecture Review| [Ethereum Credit Guild](https://credit-guild.gitbook.io/introduction/) |Provides a basic architectural teaching for General Architecture|
|3|Graphical Analysis  |Graphical Analysis with [Solidity-metrics](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-metrics)|A visual view has been made to dominate the general structure of the codes of the project.|
|4|Slither Analysis  | [Slither Report](https://github.com/crytic/slither)| Slither report of the project for some basic analysis|
|5|Test Suits|[Tests](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-autonolas?tab=readme-ov-file#tests)|In this section, the scope and content of the tests of the project are analyzed.|
|6|Manuel Code Review|[Scope](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-autonolas?tab=readme-ov-file#files-in-scope)||
|7|Infographic|[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)|Tried to make Visual drawings to understand the hard-to-understand mechanisms|
|8|Special focus on Areas of  Concern|[Areas of Concern](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-autonolas?tab=readme-ov-file#files-in-scope)|Code where I should focus more|

## b) Analysis of the code base

The most important summary in analyzing the code base is the stacking of codes to be analyzed.
In this way, many predictions can be made, including the difficulty levels of the contracts, which one is more important for the auditor, the features they contain that are important for security (payable functions, uses assembly, etc.), the audit cost of the project, and the time to be allocated to the audit;
Uses Consensys Solidity Metrics
-  **Lines:** total lines of the source unit
-  **nLines:** normalized lines of the source unit (e.g. normalizes functions spanning multiple lines)
-  **nSLOC:** normalized source lines of code (only source-code lines; no comments, no blank lines)
-  **Comment Lines:** lines containing single or block comments
-  **Complexity Score:** a custom complexity score derived from code statements that are known to introduce code complexity (branches, loops, calls, external interfaces, ...)
